# BuilderID: A Self-Sovereign Skill Passport for the Endless Developer Ecosystem

## Why?
Developers lack a standardized way to prove their skills on Web3. Resumes are outdated. LinkedIn is centralized. BuilderID solves this by leveraging Endless Protocol’s core stack: DID + ZKP + AI.

## What?
A lightweight, front-end-only prototype that allows developers to:
- Connect wallet + Social DID (mocked)
- Claim skill by uploading proof (GitHub/Figma)
- Receive AI-generated summary
- Preview and “mint” skill badges as NFTs

## How?
Built with pure HTML/CSS/JS — no backend required. Uses mock APIs and static assets. Deployable in seconds.

## Value to Endless
- Activates developer community with zero friction
- Creates verifiable reputation layer
- Enables future grant allocation based on proven skills
- Aligns with “Everyday Web3” — simple, visual, intuitive

## Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (this submission)  
Phase 2: Integrate with Endless SDK + real ZK proofs  
Phase 3: DAO voting weight based on skill level
